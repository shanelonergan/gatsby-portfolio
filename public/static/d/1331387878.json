Born and raised in Michigan, I went to Oberlin College intending to become a doctor. However, in my first semester I was lucky enough to be cast in a student theater production of the musical Next to Normal,  and my life would never be the same. A burning love of Musical Theater consumed my college years, though I held on to my Biology major, and after graduating I moved to New York to pursue my Broadway dream. After a few years though, I found there was a hole in my life Biology had once filled. In search of something to replace it, I stumbled upon some coding tutorials on youtube, and I was immediately hooked. I attended the Flatiron school, where I learned more in 15 weeks then I ever thought was possible, and met some of the most incredible people doing it. I am now seeking my first job as a developer, and freelancing on the side, and learning as much as I possibly can. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!\n"
